# Founder Opportunity Fit

Every single founder who starts a successful business is doing it based on his back-story. It's a Venn diagram of:

-   Solved some pain
-   Was paid for doing something
-   Being passionate about a topic

# Perect repeatable week

> What you're going to do every single day throughout a week.

-   Ads - For a product that costs $1,000 allocate $100 for ads.
-   Content Marketing - On 3 social platforms, as often as possible without spamming.
-   DMs/Emails - Cold messaging 100 per day.
-   1:1 sales
-   Monday week plan.
-   Friday debriefs.
-   Customer feedback sessions - How do they like your product, what do they want/need.

# Community

Create a place for your customers to gather. WhatsApp, Facebook group, Discord...

# Offering

-   Gift
-   Product for prospects (P4P) - Low risk ways for people to engage with.
-   Core - Main thing you do. Bronze, Silver, Gold.
-   Product for customer (P4C) - Extends the core product. Customizations.

Each of these needs a dedicated landing page, and brochure/slide deck. What's included, how it adds value. Features, advantages, benefits.

# 3 part year

### Part 1 - Perfect repeatable week

### Part 2 - Spotlight campaings

Every 3-4 months you do spotlight campaings that integrate with the perfect repeatable week. These are special offers like "Autumn sale".

Generate leads every week, and if they don't buy, you invite them back with the spotlight campaings, and vice versa.

### Part 3 - Annual big message

Every single content for the year is based on the same message, hit a 100 different ways.

Ex. If you are selling fitbits, the message would be "The importance od 10,000 daily steps".
